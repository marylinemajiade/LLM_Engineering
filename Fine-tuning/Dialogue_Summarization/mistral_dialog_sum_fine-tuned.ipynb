    "# Fine-tuning Dialogue Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this collab, we will fine-tune the Mistral 7B model from HuggingFace using the parameter-efficient technique (PEFT) known as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). This approach allows us to adapt the model for a specific task (Dialogue Summarization) while keeping computational costs low. We willl demonstrate how to apply LoRA and then evaluate the modelâ€™s performance before and after fine-tuning to highlight the improvements.\n",
